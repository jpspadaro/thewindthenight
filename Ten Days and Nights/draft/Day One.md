# Day One
It was a long road that Charlie was on. He'd been hiking north for a while, and was planning on eventually getting up to Canada. Trails and roads and other ways, through private property and public lands. He kept his pack stocked well enough, and had enough money saved away for the duration of the trip.

And right now, he was hitching.

Hitch hiking is one part patience, one part presentation, and one part luck. It's more than just sticking your thumb out and getting a lift. You have to convey that you, in fact, are not a serial killer, or escaped convict. You are normal, just a hiker pursuing their hobby. Make it okay to help you.

Unfortunately for Charlie, people weren't that trusting on June 10th.

## No One
The car whizzed past. It was a station wagon, driven by a guy in his late twenties. "Fuck." Charlie was getting more and more irritated as the cars passed by. He'd been walking along North Country Road since yesterday, and had to stealth camp a hundred feet in to sleep for the night.

He'd had his cup of coffee and went back to sticking his thumb out. Around noon he'd grabbed lunch and made up a sign. "Hiker - please help!" It didn't seem to be that convincing, though. At least it didn't convince the station wagon.

Charlie started walking north again. Progress was progress, and he only had one option till someone decided to pick him up. The next town was only a couple of days hike away. He could stretch his food out for a couple of days.

Another car passed (this time a black pickup truck), and he continued to walk.

Was it his week of beard growth? This was the country -- he doubted that was the issue. He looked down at his cut off shorts, dirty from camping, and his plain green teeshirt.

He walked a few more miles along the road, and came across some road kill. It looked like it may have been a deer. It was fresh, but seemed like an animal had already got to it, tearing the flesh and picking meat from the bones. It smelled, but the blood still was fresh.

Charlie took it as a sign that he should walk a bit more before grabbing dinner. A mile further down he walked into the woods and made camp. He could have tried hitching all night, but his frustration won out. He hung his hammock and tarp, and fired up his portable stove to cook up some noodles. After eating his meal , Charlie went to sleep.

He wasn't sure how late it was when he heard the animal in his camp. Maybe a bear. Or a wolf. Curiosity won and Charlie looked out of the side of the hammock, leaning down below the tarp. Fear gripped him.

A bear would not have been a big deal -- if you're not threatening cubs then they'll run off if you make enough noise. The only exception really is with grizzlies and polar bears, but they weren't native to the Adirondacks. Wolves generally avoid people, too, and if you make yourself seem like you're not worth the potential trouble they'll run off.

This was neither. It was eight feet tall and stood on two legs, covered in patches of fur. Bony spikes went down its spine, and long claws came out of the end of its dangling arms. The entire figure was hunched over, like it was leaning its elongated snout. It looked over at Charlie, making eye contact in an intense, focused way.

Its face changed, in a leering, malicious way. If it could grin, it would be. The creature turned, and stalked toward his hammock.

With a yell Charlie rolled out of his hammock and took off running through the woods. Sprinting past trees in his boxer shorts, he only occasionally looked behind himself. He saw a shadow, hulking and blurred, moving like a spot of darkness between silhouettes of foliage and trees. He came up to a cave and ran in, followed by a guttural inhuman scream.

The cave was littered with bones, and Charlie knew that he'd made mistake immediately. It got darker and darker, and he felt along the wall. Maybe he should run back to the woods? No, he thought. That would only lead him to...whatever that thing was.

## Light
A blue glow was in the distance. It seemed like something to move towards in the pitch black cave, and Charlie couldn't think of a better option. He touched the cold stone moving along the wall gradually. Occasionally he'd hear noise back towards the cave entrance, and would shuffle a little faster until he became nervous about his near blindness.

A dip ahead. It seemed to lead to the glowing blue thing.

He picked up his pace again, and eventually let go of the wall so he could jog towards the light. The sound of his feet reverberated, and the echo carried down the tunnel. Then he heard a second set of feet padding along.

He ran forward. He knew it was reckless, but he needed to see what was following him. It didn't sound like an animal, but that didn't make it any less terrifying.

He came to the edge of the dip, and stumbled, falling forward and rolling. He went down a set of stone stairs, briefly seeing what he'd been running toward. It was a large torus, made of blue glowing stone. It was bright here.

He rolled with the pain of falling down the steps, and smacked his head hard against the stone circle. For a moment before he lost consciousness, he saw a woman standing at chamber entrance he had just tripped into.
