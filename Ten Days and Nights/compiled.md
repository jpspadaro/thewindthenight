# Day One
It was a long road that Charlie was on. He'd been hiking north for a while, and was planning on eventually getting up to Canada. Trails and roads and other ways, through private property and public lands. He kept his pack stocked well enough, and had enough money saved away for the duration of the trip.

And right now, he was hitching.

Hitch hiking is one part patience, one part presentation, and one part luck. It's more than just sticking your thumb out and getting a lift. You have to convey that you, in fact, are not a serial killer, or escaped convict. You are normal, just a hiker pursuing their hobby. Make it okay to help you.

Unfortunately for Charlie, people weren't that trusting on June 10th.

## No One
The car whizzed past. It was a station wagon, driven by a guy in his late twenties. "Fuck." Charlie was getting more and more irritated as the cars passed by. He'd been walking along North Country Road since yesterday, and had to stealth camp a hundred feet in to sleep for the night.

He'd had his cup of coffee and went back to sticking his thumb out. Around noon he'd grabbed lunch and made up a sign. "Hiker - please help!" It didn't seem to be that convincing, though. At least it didn't convince the station wagon.

Charlie started walking north again. Progress was progress, and he only had one option till someone decided to pick him up. The next town was only a couple of days hike away. He could stretch his food out for a couple of days.

Another car passed (this time a black pickup truck), and he continued to walk.

Was it his week of beard growth? This was the country -- he doubted that was the issue. He looked down at his cut off shorts, dirty from camping, and his plain green teeshirt.

He walked a few more miles along the road, and came across some road kill. It looked like it may have been a deer. It was fresh, but seemed like an animal had already got to it, tearing the flesh and picking meat from the bones. It smelled, but the blood still was fresh.

Charlie took it as a sign that he should walk a bit more before grabbing dinner. A mile further down he walked into the woods and made camp. He could have tried hitching all night, but his frustration won out. He hung his hammock and tarp, and fired up his portable stove to cook up some noodles. After eating his meal , Charlie went to sleep.

He wasn't sure how late it was when he heard the animal in his camp. Maybe a bear. Or a wolf. Curiosity won and Charlie looked out of the side of the hammock, leaning down below the tarp. Fear gripped him.

A bear would not have been a big deal -- if you're not threatening cubs then they'll run off if you make enough noise. The only exception really is with grizzlies and polar bears, but they weren't native to the Adirondacks. Wolves generally avoid people, too, and if you make yourself seem like you're not worth the potential trouble they'll run off.

This was neither. It was eight feet tall and stood on two legs, covered in patches of fur. Bony spikes went down its spine, and long claws came out of the end of its dangling arms. The entire figure was hunched over, like it was leaning its elongated snout. It looked over at Charlie, making eye contact in an intense, focused way.

Its face changed, in a leering, malicious way. If it could grin, it would be. The creature turned, and stalked toward his hammock.

With a yell Charlie rolled out of his hammock and took off running through the woods. Sprinting past trees in his boxer shorts, he only occasionally looked behind himself. He saw a shadow, hulking and blurred, moving like a spot of darkness between silhouettes of foliage and trees. He came up to a cave and ran in, followed by a guttural inhuman scream.

The cave was littered with bones, and Charlie knew that he'd made mistake immediately. It got darker and darker, and he felt along the wall. Maybe he should run back to the woods? No, he thought. That would only lead him to...whatever that thing was.

## Light
A blue glow was in the distance. It seemed like something to move towards in the pitch black cave, and Charlie couldn't think of a better option. He touched the cold stone moving along the wall gradually. Occasionally he'd hear noise back towards the cave entrance, and would shuffle a little faster until he became nervous about his near blindness.

A dip ahead. It seemed to lead to the glowing blue thing.

He picked up his pace again, and eventually let go of the wall so he could jog towards the light. The sound of his feet reverberated, and the echo carried down the tunnel. Then he heard a second set of feet padding along.

He ran forward. He knew it was reckless, but he needed to see what was following him. It didn't sound like an animal, but that didn't make it any less terrifying.

He came to the edge of the dip, and stumbled, falling forward and rolling. He went down a set of stone stairs, briefly seeing what he'd been running toward. It was a large torus, made of blue glowing stone. It was bright here.

He rolled with the pain of falling down the steps, and smacked his head hard against the stone circle. For a moment before he lost consciousness, he saw a woman standing at chamber entrance he had just tripped into.


# Day Two
Fucking moron. Stupid backpackers. Tanya got up from looking at the unconscious mess that had fallen in from of the portal. She sighed.

He at least needs some real clothes, she thought, and walked back to his campsite. She'd bundle it up as best she could, and maybe he'll wake up. At least he's still breathing.

## Beginning
She'd been around the cave for a long time. It wasn't that she wanted to, but she had become bound to it, in a way. The damn portal, the damn cave, those places that she dared not enter on the other side of the forbidding circle. Tanya wanted out. She wanted freedom. There was no freedom. There was no out.

She went back to his campsite, trying to get his equipment as carefully as she could, considering the circumstances. At least some of the stuff could be useful for her. She chuckled to herself...and worst case he could be food. That wasn't a real option, though. It was still cannibalism, even if he was a stupid backpacker.

She easily picked up the bundled gear, wrapped in his hammock tarp. She left the hammock, though. He could get that himself later if he's still alive. The fuel, food, and tools could be useful, though. Maybe the cell phone, too, but she was more suspicious of that.

Tanya took her time going back through the woods. The night didn't bother her; she liked it at this point. She didn't fear anything in the forest other than the cave. No, not the cave -- the portal.

The trip had a familiarity for her. It reminded her of when she'd first found the portal herself. She'd discovered the cave in the woods, walking through like she was now. Her friends, Alex, Sam, and Joe, they'd been with her. Alex and Joe were assholes.

She frowned thinking of it. They'd coerced Samantha into walking through the damn thing. Tanya stood her ground, and when no one came back through, after one day, then two...by that night all she could do was lean against the blue thing crying. She started hiking back towards the road, and by that time she was committed.

The hiker's pack was getting heavier the closer she got to the cave. She dropped it right outside the entrance, and walked the familiar path back to the stupid backpacker.

## Woke
Charlie came to in the morning, sitting up and rubbing his face. He couldn't tell it was morning from the day light, but he looked down at his wrist watch and saw it was 9AM. His head hurt and he was in a teeshirt and boxers. Everything had a blue cast around it.

A girl in her twenties was sitting cross legged across the cave from him. She was wearing some of his clothes...an old teeshirt he'd picked up from a thrift store and a pair of shorts. She was watching him with an intense focus. He vaguely remembered her from moments before he passed out.

"Where am I?" It was the best he could manage, a simple question of status working with the assumption that she had a better idea what was going on than he did. Her hair and face were a mess, but it was obvious that she'd been awake for while.

She grunted. "A cave. What does it look like?" She stood up and walked towards him, offering him a hand to stand up.

He took it. "Did you see that thing last night? It was fucked up."

Tanya frowned. "Yeah."

"Is it still outside?"

"No."

Charlie looked away for a second. "Well, ummm... My name's Charlie by the way."

"I'm Tanya. Your gear's outside."

"Okay. You can keep the clothes if you want."

"Thanks."

Maybe he can get away, she thought. Give him a chance. Maybe it won't affect him.

Charlie walked out of the cave, into the sun. His gear was where he was told,  in a disorganized bundle in his hammock tarp. His hammock was missing, though.

He sighed, and started walking towards where his camp had been.

His sense of direction was good enough that he had an idea of where he needed to go. It wasn't so far away that he couldn't make a good guess, and he just had to be close enough to find the road. From there he could walk to where he entered the woods to set up his hammock, then back to where he slept last night. It was straight forward.

As he worked his way between trees and past rocks he began to feel his skin crawl. It was an odd feeling, like something was quite right. And it began to harden. And scale. He was still in his boxers, which were beginning to pull tight in back, as a muscular appendage began to form from above his ass. He itched at it subconsciously, noticing small arms coning from his sides.

"What the fuck?" His eyes went wide. "What the fuck? What's going on?" He heard a crackle in the distance and flicked his tongue. It sounded like a large animal stepping on branches.

It approached, half wolf thing, half Tanya. "Awe fuck. It got you two." She rubbed her face with her clawed fingers, covered in patches of fur. "God damn it."

"What the fuck? What is this?" Charlie was screeching. He was beginning to notice other senses of light as the set of secondary eyes located above his usual pair began to become sensitive. "What is going on?"

Tanya began to strip. "Just go back to the cave. I'll grab your hammock and meet you back there. If we go much farther we'll outgrow our clothes. You're already two inches taller than when you left. Just...go." The nightmare overshadowed Charlie's libido, as she pulled the top and shorts off, showing her naked, demi-human body.

Charlie began the walk back, looking back once to see her form swell and become coated in hair as she ran in the direction of the hammock. the closer he got to the cave, the more normal he became, reverting back to Charlie the hiker.

## Prayer For A Dead God
> When times were old, Morgreth had prayed. He has set the stones. He burned the fire and looked into the sun for just a moment. The animal had died, and the bones were laid in a circle as the stones.
>
>When times were old Morgreth had looked into the pool of water in the sacred bowl at the center of it all. Time had taken the creator. Change in all things. He knew this, but still he prayed. Why? Because it was a time for dead gods. And gods rarely stay dead.
>
> Morgreth knew he would never see the gate. But others would. He had come a long way, across an ocean, to find the thinnest spot. It was here. And with each incantation and spoken rite his mouth became larger. Soon his mouth became wide enough, and the earth swallowed him up, and he became stone. All that remained was the glow that had been bestowed on him at the last moment.

## Lunch
"I miss this."

"It's dried noodles. It barely qualifies as food."

"It's still human food." Tanya smiled to herself sitting in the mouth of the cave, twirling the noodles with her plastic fork. "And it's been years since I had a meal with another person. A real person."

Charlie was not nearly as happy about the situation. "Do I need to worry about fake people?"

Tanya looked up. "It's been lonely the last few years. Real fucking lonely." Her eyes were hard.

"I bet."

"Sometimes I can get a glimpse of the outside world. Someone will leave their smartphone and there'll be service long enough for me to look at the world outside online."

Charlie was absorbing a lot of this. This was his new normal. He felt like he had to accept it, at least on some level. How long had she been trapped here? Did it matter at this point?

"So have you tried going through the portal?"

"I saw my friends go through. They never came back. Considering what happened just because I touched it, I figured it couldn't be any better going in."

Charlie nodded. That could be a good point. "What about killing yourself if it's so terrible? No one would blame you."

Tanya set her noodles down on the ground and stared vacantly at the ground. "I can't. I bet you can't either. I tried. One time I threw myself down a cliff. Had to be four hundred feet of drop. Do you know what it's like feeling every bone in your body get pulverized? Then having to lay there day in, day out, not starving, but slowly having them heal? And heal wrong? I had to re-break everything so I could set them correctly so they'd work right. That was a lot slower." She looked up at him, and despair and pain and history all hang there loose on her face.

Charlie looked back at his noodles, trying not to think about it.

"So we're stuck?"

"Yeah."

Charlie finished his noodles. "I want to go past the road."

"That's about the point where my mind starts to get fuzzy. It's kind of weird...it's hard to describe."

"Like the monster begins to take over?"

"Yeah."

"Fuck."

Charlie picked up a twig, and started bending it, snapping it into smaller pieces. He was looking into the distance.
