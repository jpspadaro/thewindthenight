# Whistle

> Oh, there's a lot going on there. Ummm…well, John was…complex. He didn't really get along with anyone, per se, but nobody really hated him, at least as far as I know. He just kind of did his own thing. He'd be going along, whistling this same weird tune to himself. Doing whatever. Who knows?
> 
> Apparently, as far as anyone can tell, I was the closest he had to a friend, but we were just neighbors. We lived next to each other, in the same apartment complex. We'd talk a little in the hall outside our places sometimes, and once I helped him jump his car when his battery was dead.

> He'd left the lights on all night and they'd killed it.

> He'd seemed so quiet, and…I guess normal. What they found out later surprised the hell out of me.
