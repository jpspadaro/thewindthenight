Jonas was about three miles out from the ranger station, but it seemed more than an hours walk away. He tied his bandana around his head, and stretched in the morning air. He was lanky and tall, and arching his back made him feel lanky and tall. He popped his knuckles on both hands, and went over to his hanging bear bag to get oatmeal for breakfast.

He was taking a side trail north towards the center of Coven Forest today, and had to stop by a clean water source, a stream, along the way.
