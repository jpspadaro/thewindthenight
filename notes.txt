A backpacker is travelling north through the Adirondacks, and while hitch hiking late at night encounters a creature in the woods.

*Why doesn't Charlie run away?*
He's too far away to get to town in time. The monster would get him.

*What is the monster?*
What the hell...a werewolf like thing sounds good. A girl named Tanya who is werewolf like who is guarding the gate.

*Gate?*
It's a dimensional gate. People enter it and never return. People touch it and...change. Like becoming a werewolf-thing.

*Werewolf thing?*
Yeah, kinda like a werewolf, but not dictated by the moon. The farther Tanya gets from the gate, the more animal like she becomes. North Country road is about how far she can go while still retaining some of her humanity.

*Why doesn't Charlie just gtfo?*
When he runs from Tanya, he runs away from the road (not the plan) and toward a cave. In the cave he touches the portal, and is stuck in a similar position to Tanya.
