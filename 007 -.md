"I can't remember." Lauren looked over at Jonas for just a second, then back at the trail ahead.

Jonas could tell she was upset, but trying not to think about it. They were walking along the trail, which matched the route he was originally planning on taking. It was a coincidence, but not too surprising. There were a set number of trails maintained throughout Coven, and this one was a major one, with various spurs and side paths. It was also relatively straight, without many switch-backs except where elevation changes made it more prudent.

She couldn't rememberâ€¦ She couldn't remember how she had got to the stream. She couldn't remember how long she had been there. She was lost, but couldn't remember where she was lost from.
