# Lost

"I can't remember." Lauren looked over at Jonas for just a second, then back at the trail ahead.

Jonas could tell she was upset, but trying not to think about it. They were walking along the trail, which matched the route he was originally planning on taking. It was a coincidence, but not too surprising. There were a set number of trails maintained throughout Coven, and this one was a major one, with various spurs and side paths. It was also relatively straight, without many switch-backs except where elevation changes made it more prudent.

She couldn't remember… She couldn't remember how she had got to the stream. She couldn't remember how long she had been there. She was lost, but couldn't remember where she was lost from.

In general it seemed like her memory had an enormous gap. Names, places, and events all eluded her. She knew who she was. She was Lauren. Lauren…what was her last name? She had to have a last name.

She stopped walking and leaned against a tree, arms crossed. She had to have a last name.

"What's up?" Jonas stopped and looked at her, his thumbs hooked behind his pack's shoulder straps.

"Nothing."

"Think I should find a campsite?"

Lauren shook her head. "No…I just need a moment. Maybe we can rest for a bit."

Jonas set his pack down. "Sounds good to me."
