# Day One

It was a long road that Charlie was on. He'd been hiking north for a while, and was planning on eventually getting up to Canada. Trails and roads and other ways, through private property and public lands. He kept his pack stocked well enough, and had enough saved away for the duration of the trip.

And right now, he was hitching.

Hitching is one part patience, one part presentation, and one part luck. It's more than just sticking your thumb out and getting a lift. You have to convey that you, in fact are not a serial killer, or escaped convict. You are normal, just a hiker pursuing their hobby. Make it okay to help you.

Unfortunately for Charlie, people weren't trusting on June 10th.

## No One
The car whizzed past. It was a station wagon, driven by a guy in his late twenties. "Fuck." Charlie was getting more and more irritated as the cars passed by. He'd been walking along North Country Road since yesterday, and had to stealth camp a hundred feet in to sleep.

He'd had his cup of coffee and went back to sticking his thumb out. Around noon he'd grabbed lunch and made up a sign. "Hiker - please help!" It didn't seem to be that convincing, though. At least it didn't convince the station wagon.

Charlie started walking north again. Progress was progress, and he only had one option till someone decided to pick him up. The next town was only a couple of days hike away. He could stretch his food out for a couple of days.

Another car passed (this time a black pickup truck), and he continued to walk.

Was it his week of beard growth? This was
